I have also reviewed these records at University Hospital. TK has a long-standing history of hypertension and dyslipidemia that lead to severe aortic valve sclerosis and stenosis with subsequent aortic valve replacement in 2004 with a bioprosthetic valve. His valvular  Heart disease has led to left ventricular enlargement and a diastolic dysfunction with a preserved ejection fraction, pulmonary artery hypertension, biatrial enlargement and persistent atrial fibrillation. He is not on any anticoagulation, which is due to history of non-compliance. Indeed, he was admitted to the hospital in 2001 with an INR of 9.8. His cardiologist is Dr. RC and I have viewed his outpatient notes. The anticoagulation for his bioprosthetic valve and atrial fibrillation is management with aspirin only. He has not had any DVTs, pulmonary embolism or strokes. There is no family history of blood clots that he knows of. The last time he was seen by Dr.RC was November 2008. At that time,  he was complaining of dypnea and wheezing. He was believed to be suffering from decompensated diastolic heart failure and an echo at that time showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular ejection fraction was normal. The left atrium was moderately dilated, the right atrium is mild to moderately dilated and there was mild mitral regurgitation. The gradient across the AVR was 36 mm per hg. This was changed from an echo in 2006.  His lasix was continued and his Atacand was increased. His atrial fibrillation was well-controlled at the time. He does not have a significant history of alcohol abuse. He has drunk alcohol for a majority of his life, he says, since the age of 16. He continued to drink alcohol regularly.  He says he was in the Japanese Navy and he was in the military for quite some time. He equates his with a habit of excessive alcohol abuse. He has drunk large quantities of scotch whiskey and beer over the years.  I can't really quantitate exactly how much over the years he has been drinking but I get the feeling that he over time has consumed a great deal of alcohol and as I mentioned he continued to drink. I have reviewed his records and he holds no diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease per se.  But as he had a remote history of esophageal varices, he knows of no history of liver disease. He denies any history of hepatitis. He has had blood transfusions approximately 40 years ago. He denies any history of lower GI bleeding.

barrier and mild confusion and his son helps provide historical data for him i have also reviewed his records at university hospital tk has a long standing history of hypertension and and dyslipidemia that lead to severe aortic valve cirrhosis and stenosis with subsequent aortic valve replacement in 2004 with a bioprosthetic valve his valvular heart disease has led to left ventricular enlargement and diastolic dysfunction with a preserved ejection fraction pulmonary artery hypertension bi atrial enlargement and persistent atrial fibrillation he is not on any anticoagulation which is due to a history of non compliance indeed he was admitted to the hospital in 2001 with an inr of 9.8 his cardiologist is doctor r c and i have reviewed his outpatient notes the anticoagulation for his bioprosthetic valve and atrial for fibrillation is management with aspirin only he has not had any the dvts pulmonary embolism or strokes there is no family history of blood clots that he knows of the last time he was seen by doctor rc was november 2008 at that time he was complaining of tachypnoea and wheezing he was believed to be suffering from decompensated diastolic heart failure and an echo at that time showed mild concentric left ventricular hypotrophy the left ventricular ejection friction was normal the left atrium was moderately dilated the right atrium is regurgitation the gradient across the avr was 36 mm hg this was unchanged from an echo in 2006 his lasik was continued and his attack end was increased his atrial fibrillation was well controlled at that time he does have a significant history of alcohol abuse he has drunk alcohol for majority of his life he says since the age of 16 he continues to drink alcohol regularly he says he was in japanese navy and he was in the

He refused surgery at that time. He developed worsening congestive heart failure in 2004 and an echo revealed a valve area was 0.6cm2  A repeat cardiac catheterization revealed no coronary artery disease and he underwent an aortic valve replacement in November 2004 by Dr. P at University Hospital.

History of present illness. Mr. TK has difficulty relating his history secondary to a language barrier and mild confusion and his son helps provide historical data for him. I have also reviewed his records  at University Hospital. TK has a long-standing history of hypertension and dyslipidemia that lead to severe aortic valve sclerosis and stenosis with subsequent aortic valve replacement in 2004 with a bioprosthetic valve.

History of present illness. (6195/unit or 6.195 credit)  Mr. TK has difficulty relating his history secondary to a language barrier and mild confusion and his son helps provide historical data for him. I have also reviewed these records at University Hospital. TK has a long-standing history of hypertension and dyslipidemia that lead to severe aortic valve sclerosis and stenosis with subsequent aortic valve replacement in 2004 with a bioprosthetic valve. His valvular  Heart disease has led to left ventricular enlargement and a diastolic dysfunction with a preserved ejection fraction, pulmonary artery hypertension, biatrial enlargement and persistent atrial fibrillation. He is not on any anticoagulation, which is due to history of non-compliance. Indeed, he was admitted to the hospital in 2001 with an INR of 9.8. His cardiologist is Dr. RC and I have viewed his outpatient notes. The anticoagulation for his bioprosthetic valve and  atrial fibrillation is management with aspirin only. He has not had any DVTs, pulmonary embolism or strokes. There is no family history of blood clots that he knows of. The last time he was seen by Dr.RC was November 2008. At that time,  he was complaining of dypnea and wheezing. He was believed to be suffering from decompensated diastolic heart failure and an echo at that time showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular ejection fraction was normal. The left atrium was moderately dilated, the right atrium is mild to moderately dilated and there was mild mitral regurgitation. The gradient across the AVR was 36 mm per hg. This was changed from an echo in 2006.  His last six weeks continued and his Atacand was increased. His atrial fibrillation was well-controlled at the time. He does not have a significant history of alcohol abuse. He has drunk alcohol for a majority of his life, he says, since the age of 16. He continued to drink alcohol regularly.  He says he was in the Japanese Navy and he was in the military for quite some time. He equates his with a habit of excessive alcohol abuse.","complaint open forget for 76 kato s less unit or 0.476 kcl is in 80 kcl is in 80 kcl is in 80 kcl is in . - old japanese gentleman with a history of severe aortic stenosis status post aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation with a history of congestive heart failure from diastolic dysfunction, and alcohol abuse with a history of varices who comes in the chief. , problems within and catching my breath associated with volume of my legs of several weeks duration and more recently intermittent confusion which is related to my his son. . history of present illness opened by 26-195. he explained by 95 credit closely. . mr tke has difficulty relating his history secondary to a language failure and mild confusion and his son helps provide his story as data for him. i will also include his record at university hospital. an dsd level that leads to a severe aortic valve cirrhosis and cirrhosis with subsequent aortic valve replacement into 2004 with the antibiotic valve. his valvular heart is slared to left ventricular enlargement and diastolic dysfunction with the pleasate in the patient. injection function, pulmonary artery hypertension, bile-atrial enlargement and persistent atrial fibrillation. he is not on any anti-globulation which is due to a history of lung compliance. indeed, he was admitted to the hospital into . 2001 with an inr of 9.8. his cardiologist is dr. rc and i have reviewed his admission note. the anticoagulation for his biopsypan and atrial fibrillation is management with aspirin only. he has had any other reason for this procedure. d.m. pulmonary embolism or strokes. there is no family history of biotx denies of. the last thing you will see by dr. absee was november, 2008. at that time he was complaining of diarrhea and raising. he was believed to be following one to compensate one. physiological failure and an end at bedtime sold mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, the left ventricular induction osimhens, left atrial course moderately dilated, the right atrial is now . hra pradeshs were attacked at 16 countries. the gradient across everywhere else 36 mmhg. those was unchanged from an angle in 2006. with lasix was 20 and his attack index increased. his entire population was well controlled at that time. he was drawn alcohol from majority of his life since the age of 16. he continues to drain alcohol regularly. he says he was intubin his navy, and he was in the military for quite an time. he equates with a heard of excessive alcohol use .","complaint open forget for 76 kato s less unit or 0.476 kcl is in 80 kcl is in 80 kcl is in 80 kcl is in . -

I have also reviewed these records at University Hospital. TK has a long-standing history of hypertension and dyslipidemia that lead to severe aortic valve sclerosis and stenosis with subsequent aortic valve replacement in 2004 with a bioprosthetic valve. His valvular  Heart disease has led to left ventricular enlargement and a diastolic dysfunction with a preserved ejection fraction, pulmonary artery hypertension, biatrial enlargement and persistent atrial fibrillation. He is not on any anticoagulation, which is due to history of non-compliance. Indeed, he was admitted to the hospital in 2001 with an INR of 9.8. His cardiologist is Dr. RC and I have viewed his outpatient notes. The anticoagulation for his bioprosthetic valve and atrial fibrillation is management with aspirin only. He has not had any DVTs, pulmonary embolism or strokes. There is no family history of blood clots that he knows of. The last time he was seen by Dr.RC was November 2008. At that time,  he was complaining of dypnea and wheezing. He was believed to be suffering from decompensated diastolic heart failure and an echo at that time showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular ejection fraction was normal. The left atrium was moderately dilated, the right atrium is mild to moderately dilated and there was mild mitral regurgitation. The gradient across the AVR was 36 mm per hg. This was changed from an echo in 2006.  His lasix was continued and his Atacand was increased. His atrial fibrillation was well-controlled at the time. He does not have a significant history of alcohol abuse. He has drunk alcohol for a majority of his life, he says, since the age of 16. He continued to drink alcohol regularly.  He says he was in the Japanese Navy and he was in the military for quite some time. He equates his with a habit of excessive alcohol abuse. He has drunk large quantities of scotch whiskey and beer over the years.  I can't really quantitate exactly how much over the years he has been drinking but I get the feeling that he over time has consumed a great deal of alcohol and as I mentioned he continued to drink. I have reviewed his records and he holds no diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease per se.  But as he had a remote history of esophageal varices, he knows of no history of liver disease. He denies any history of hepatitis. He has had blood transfusions approximately 40 years ago. He denies any history of lower GI bleeding. He did have an upper endoscopy in 2004 prior to his aortic valve replacement that showed only portal hypertensive gastropathy but no esophageal varices.","history of present illness- mr. tke has

aortic valve replacement in 2004 with a bioprosthetic valve. his valvular heart disease has led to left ventricular enlargement and a diastolic dysfunction with a preserved ejection fraction, pulmonary artery hypertension, biatrial enlargement and persistent atrial fibrillation. he is not on any anticoagulation, which is due to history of non-compliance. indeed, he was admitted to the

was complaining of dypnea and wheezing. he was believed to be suffering from decompensated diastolic heart failure and an echo at that time showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. the

She claims she was sexually assaulted by a neighbour  in their area but she was scared of giving out the information. Her madam who she works for noticed that she had been walking with difficulty and when she now questioned the  house girl that's when she now opened up. She claimed she has never had any sexual intercourse in the past. When I examined her she was rather anxious. She was not pale.

Mr. TK has difficulty relating his history secondary to a language barrier and mild confusion and his son helps provide historical data for him. I have also reviewed these records at University Hospital. TK has a long-standing history of hypertension and dyslipidemia that lead to severe aortic valve sclerosis and stenosis with subsequent aortic valve replacement in 2004 with a bioprosthetic valve. His valvular  Heart disease has led to left ventricular enlargement and a diastolic dysfunction with a preserved ejection fraction, pulmonary artery hypertension, biatrial enlargement and persistent atrial fibrillation. He is not on any anticoagulantion, which is due to history of non-compliance. Indeed, he was admitted to the hospital in 2001 with an INR of 9.8. His cardiologist is Dr. RC and I have viewed his outpatient notes. The anticoagulation for his bioprosthetic valve and  atrial fibrillation is management with aspirin only. He has not had any DVTs, pulmonary embolism or strokes. There is no family history of blood clots that he knows of. The last time he was seen by Dr.RC was November 2008. At that time,  he was complaining of dypnea and wheezing. He was believed to be suffering from decompensated diastolic heart failure and an echo at that time showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular ejection fraction was normal. The left atrium was moderately dilated, the right atrium is mild to moderately dilated and there was mild mitral regurgitation. The gradient across the AVR was 36 mm per hg. This was changed from an echo in 2006.  His last six weeks continued and his Atacand was increased. His atrial fibrillation was well controlled at the time. He does not have a significant history of alcohol abuse. He has drunk alcohol for a majority of his life, he says, since the age of 16. He continued to drink alcohol regularly.  He says he was in the Japanese Navy and he was in the military for quite some time. He equates his with a habit of excessive alcohol abuse.","complaint open forget for 76 kato s less unit or 0.476 kcl is in 80 kcl is in 80 kcl is in 80 kcl is in . - old japanese gentleman with a

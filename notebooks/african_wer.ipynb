It's been quite a rewarding experience.  seeing children leaving my clinic with smiles on their faces and seeing their parents beaming, knowing that options that were previously unavailable to them are now available to them to help improve the physical appearances of their wards.  It's a fun job and I usually am satisfied at the end of the day. Also one of the most highly rewarding specialties in dentistry. But in Nigeria and other parts of the world, I would like you to come visit us one of these days. Thank you for listening.</td>\n",

       "0    Hello, my name is Tolu. I'm an orthodontist in a tertiary hospital in Nigeria. I deal in correcting malocclusions in children and adults and giving them aesthetic smiles. It's been quite a rewarding experience.  seeing children leaving my clinic with smiles on their faces and seeing their parents beaming, knowing that options that were previously unavailable to them are now available to them to help improve the physical appearances of their wards.  It's a fun job and I usually am satisfied at the end of the day. Also one of the most highly rewarding specialties in dentistry. But in Nigeria and other parts of the world, I would like you to come visit us one of these days. Thank you for listening.   \n",

       "0    Hello, my name is Tolu. I'm an orthodontist in a tertiary hospital in Nigeria. I deal in correcting malocclusions in children and adults and giving them aesthetic smiles. It's been quite a rewarding experience.  seeing children leaving my clinic with smiles on their faces and seeing their parents beaming, knowing that options that were previously unavailable to them are now available to them to help improve the physical appearances of their wards.  It's a fun job and I usually am satisfied at the end of the day. Also one of the most highly rewarding specialties in dentistry. But in Nigeria and other parts of the world, I would like you to come visit us one of these days. Thank you for listening.   \n",

       "0    Hello, my name is Tolu. I'm an orthodontist in a tertiary hospital in Nigeria. I deal in correcting malocclusions in children and adults and giving them aesthetic smiles. It's been quite a rewarding experience.  seeing children leaving my clinic with smiles on their faces and seeing their parents beaming, knowing that options that were previously unavailable to them are now available to them to help improve the physical appearances of their wards.  It's a fun job and I usually am satisfied at the end of the day. Also one of the most highly rewarding specialties in dentistry. But in Nigeria and other parts of the world, I would like you to come visit us one of these days. Thank you for listening.   \n",

       "0    Hello, my name is Tolu. I'm an orthodontist in a tertiary hospital in Nigeria. I deal in correcting malocclusions in children and adults and giving them aesthetic smiles. It's been quite a rewarding experience.  seeing children leaving my clinic with smiles on their faces and seeing their parents beaming, knowing that options that were previously unavailable to them are now available to them to help improve the physical appearances of their wards.  It's a fun job and I usually am satisfied at the end of the day. Also one of the most highly rewarding specialties in dentistry. But in Nigeria and other parts of the world, I would like you to come visit us one of these days. Thank you for listening.   \n",

       "0    Hello, my name is Tolu. I'm an orthodontist in a tertiary hospital in Nigeria. I deal in correcting malocclusions in children and adults and giving them aesthetic smiles. It's been quite a rewarding experience.  seeing children leaving my clinic with smiles on their faces and seeing their parents beaming, knowing that options that were previously unavailable to them are now available to them to help improve the physical appearances of their wards.  It's a fun job and I usually am satisfied at the end of the day. Also one of the most highly rewarding specialties in dentistry. But in Nigeria and other parts of the world, I would like you to come visit us one of these days. Thank you for listening.   \n",

       "0    Hello, my name is Tolu. I'm an orthodontist in a tertiary hospital in Nigeria. I deal in correcting malocclusions in children and adults and giving them aesthetic smiles. It's been quite a rewarding experience.  seeing children leaving my clinic with smiles on their faces and seeing their parents beaming, knowing that options that were previously unavailable to them are now available to them to help improve the physical appearances of their wards.  It's a fun job and I usually am satisfied at the end of the day. Also one of the most highly rewarding specialties in dentistry. But in Nigeria and other parts of the world, I would like you to come visit us one of these days. Thank you for listening.   \n",

       "0    Hello, my name is Tolu. I'm an orthodontist in a tertiary hospital in Nigeria. I deal in correcting malocclusions in children and adults and giving them aesthetic smiles. It's been quite a rewarding experience.  seeing children leaving my clinic with smiles on their faces and seeing their parents beaming, knowing that options that were previously unavailable to them are now available to them to help improve the physical appearances of their wards.  It's a fun job and I usually am satisfied at the end of the day. Also one of the most highly rewarding specialties in dentistry. But in Nigeria and other parts of the world, I would like you to come visit us one of these days. Thank you for listening.   \n",

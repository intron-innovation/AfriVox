I have also reviewed these records at University Hospital. TK has a long-standing history of hypertension and dyslipidemia that lead to severe aortic valve sclerosis and stenosis with subsequent aortic valve replacement in 2004 with a bioprosthetic valve. His valvular  Heart disease has led to left ventricular enlargement and a diastolic dysfunction with a preserved ejection fraction, pulmonary artery hypertension, biatrial enlargement and persistent atrial fibrillation. He is not on any anticoagulation, which is due to history of non-compliance. Indeed, he was admitted to the hospital in 2001 with an INR of 9.8. His cardiologist is Dr. RC and I have viewed his outpatient notes. The anticoagulation for his bioprosthetic valve and atrial fibrillation is management with aspirin only. He has not had any DVTs, pulmonary embolism or strokes. There is no family history of blood clots that he knows of. The last time he was seen by Dr.RC was November 2008. At that time,  he was complaining of dypnea and wheezing. He was believed to be suffering from decompensated diastolic heart failure and an echo at that time showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular ejection fraction was normal. The left atrium was moderately dilated, the right atrium is mild to moderately dilated and there was mild mitral regurgitation. The gradient across the AVR was 36 mm per hg. This was changed from an echo in 2006.  His lasix was continued and his Atacand was increased. His atrial fibrillation was well-controlled at the time. He does not have a significant history of alcohol abuse. He has drunk alcohol for a majority of his life, he says, since the age of 16. He continued to drink alcohol regularly.  He says he was in the Japanese Navy and he was in the military for quite some time. He equates his with a habit of excessive alcohol abuse. He has drunk large quantities of scotch whiskey and beer over the years.  I can't really quantitate exactly how much over the years he has been drinking but I get the feeling that he over time has consumed a great deal of alcohol and as I mentioned he continued to drink. I have reviewed his records and he holds no diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease per se.  But as he had a remote history of esophageal varices, he knows of no history of liver disease.

I have also reviewed his records at University Hospital. TK has a long-standing history of hypertension and  and dyslipidemia that lead to severe aortic valve cirrhosis and stenosis with subsequent aortic valve replacement in 2004 with a bioprosthetic valve. His valvular heart disease has led to left ventricular enlargement and diastolic dysfunction with a preserved ejection fraction, pulmonary artery hypertension, bi-atrial enlargement, and persistent atrial fibrillation. He is not on any anticoagulation which is due to a history of non-compliance. Indeed, he was admitted to the hospital in 2001 with an INR of 9.8. His cardiologist is Dr. R.C and I have reviewed his outpatient notes. The anticoagulation for his bioprosthetic valve and atrial for fibrillation is management with aspirin only. He has not had any  the  DVTs, pulmonary embolism or  strokes. There is no family history of blood clots that  he knows of. The last time he was seen by Dr RC was November, 2008. At that time, he was complaining of tachypnoea and wheezing. He was believed to be suffering from decompensated diastolic heart failure and an Echo at that time showed mild concentric left ventricular hypotrophy, the left ventricular ejection friction was normal, the left atrium was moderately dilated, the right atrium is...regurgitation. The gradient across the AVR was 36mm Hg. This was unchanged from an Echo in 2006. His Lasik was continued and his attack end was increased. His atrial fibrillation was well controlled at that time. He does have a significant history of alcohol abuse.  He has drunk alcohol for majority of his life, he says, since the age of 16. He continues to drink alcohol regularly. He says he was in Japanese Navy, and he was in the military for quite some time. He equates this with the habit of excessive alcohol use.",,2576,,a0b8f639-79b3-4e5d-9a26-a575e27f8741,Production-Test-Set-Quality,a803a5ad-530d-4c18-bf4f-a9671e672d80,LABELER,ACTIVE,19-25,Male,Yoruba,Non-Health,,IntronHealth,Researcher,"Abuja, Nigeria",NG,0,0,0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,,0,0,,

Okay, so where we, clear.  No, there's no need to clear,. Let's just continue. Let's see if the problem was because we went away from it. Okay, so let's go.  Good morning, Mr. Johnson. It's nice to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last appointment? Good morning, Doctor. Well, I've had some ups and downs. The pain in my lower back has improved a bit with the medication you prescribed, but I'm still experiencing occasional stiffness and discomfort.  I'm glad to hear that there's been some improvements. Let's start by reviewing your medical history. You mentioned in our last session that you have a history of osteoarthritis in your family. Can you provide me with some more details about that? Of course.  My mother and grandmother both had osteoarthritis and experienced joint pain and limited mobility as they got older. I have always been quite active but lately I have noticed that my joints seem to be bordering me more than usual. Thank you for sharing that information. Given your family history and your current symptoms, it's important for us to consider the possibility of osteoarthritis as a contributing factor to your discomfort. However, we need to gather more information.  before arriving at a definitive diagnosis. Have you noticed any particular activities or movement that seem to exacerbate your symptoms? Yes, definitely. I have noticed that prolonged sitting or standing tends to make my lower back ache more. Also bending over or lifting heavy objects seem to cause a sharp pain in my lower back. Alright, thank you very much, Mr. Johnson. It was nice to have this chat with you.",,1657,,a0b8f639-79b3-4e5d-9a26-a575e27f8741,Production-Test-Set-Quality,808e6b3c-4f8b-4907-8426-ae8f18b1cf9f,LABELER,ACTIVE,19-25,Female,Yoruba,Non-Health,,Not Applicable,Other,"London, United Kingdom",NG,0,0,0,0.0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,,1,,,

History of present illness. (6195/unit or 6.195 credit)  Mr. TK has difficulty relating his history secondary to a language barrier and mild confusion and his son helps provide historical data for him. I have also reviewed these records at University Hospital. TK has a long-standing history of hypertension and dyslipidemia that lead to severe aortic valve sclerosis and stenosis with subsequent aortic valve replacement in 2004 with a bioprosthetic valve. His valvular  Heart disease has led to left ventricular enlargement and a diastolic dysfunction with a preserved ejection fraction, pulmonary artery hypertension, biatrial enlargement and persistent atrial fibrillation. He is not on any anticoagulation, which is due to history of non-compliance. Indeed, he was admitted to the hospital in 2001 with an INR of 9.8. His cardiologist is Dr. RC and I have viewed his outpatient notes. The anticoagulation for his bioprosthetic valve and  atrial fibrillation is management with aspirin only. He has not had any DVTs, pulmonary embolism or strokes. There is no family history of blood clots that he knows of. The last time he was seen by Dr.RC was November 2008. At that time,  he was complaining of dypnea and wheezing. He was believed to be suffering from decompensated diastolic heart failure and an echo at that time showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular ejection fraction was normal. The left atrium was moderately dilated, the right atrium is mild to moderately dilated and there was mild mitral regurgitation. The gradient across the AVR was 36 mm per hg. This was changed from an echo in 2006.  His last six weeks continued and his Atacand was increased. His atrial fibrillation was well-controlled at the time. He does not have a significant history of alcohol abuse. He has drunk alcohol for a majority of his life, he says, since the age of 16. He continued to drink alcohol regularly.  He says he was in the Japanese Navy and he was in the military for quite some time. He equates his with a habit of excessive alcohol abuse.",,2603,,a0b8f639-79b3-4e5d-9a26-a575e27f8741,Production-Test-Set-Quality,a803a5ad-530d-4c18-bf4f-a9671e672d80,LABELER,ACTIVE,19-25,Male,Yoruba,Non-Health,,IntronHealth,Researcher,"Abuja, Nigeria",NG,0,0,0,0.0,1,0,,1,0,,0,,0,1,,

His valvular  Heart disease has led to left ventricular enlargement and a diastolic dysfunction with a preserved ejection fraction, pulmonary artery hypertension, biatrial enlargement and persistent atrial fibrillation. He is not on any anticoagulation, which is due to history of non-compliance. Indeed, he was admitted to the hospital in 2001 with an INR of 9.8. His cardiologist is Dr. RC and I have viewed his outpatient notes. The anticoagulation for his bioprosthetic valve and atrial fibrillation is management with aspirin only. He has not had any DVTs, pulmonary embolism or strokes. There is no family history of blood clots that he knows of. The last time he was seen by Dr.RC was November 2008. At that time,  he was complaining of dypnea and wheezing. He was believed to be suffering from decompensated diastolic heart failure and an echo at that time showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular ejection fraction was normal. The left atrium was moderately dilated, the right atrium is mild to moderately dilated and there was mild mitral regurgitation. The gradient across the AVR was 36 mm per hg. This was changed from an echo in 2006.  His lasix was continued and his Atacand was increased. His atrial fibrillation was well-controlled at the time. He does not have a significant history of alcohol abuse. He has drunk alcohol for a majority of his life, he says, since the age of 16. He continued to drink alcohol regularly.  He says he was in the Japanese Navy and he was in the military for quite some time. He equates his with a habit of excessive alcohol abuse. He has drunk large quantities of scotch whiskey and beer over the years.  I can't really quantitate exactly how much over the years he has been drinking but I get the feeling that he over time has consumed a great deal of alcohol and as I mentioned he continued to drink. I have reviewed his records and he holds no diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease per se.  But as he had a remote history of esophageal varices, he knows of no history of liver disease. He denies any history of hepatitis. He has had blood transfusions approximately 40 years ago. He denies any history of lower GI bleeding. He did have an upper endoscopy in 2004 prior to his aortic valve replacement that showed only portal hypertensive gastropathy but no esophageal varices.",,2788,,a0b8f639-79b3-4e5d-9a26-a575e27f8741,Production-Test-Set-Quality,a803a5ad-530d-4c18-bf4f-a9671e672d80,LABELER,ACTIVE,19-25,Male,Yoruba,Non-Health,,IntronHealth,Researcher,"Abuja, Nigeria",NG,0,0,0,0.0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,

Mr. TK has difficulty relating his history secondary to a language barrier and mild confusion and his son helps provide historical data for him. I have also reviewed these records at University Hospital. TK has a long-standing history of hypertension and dyslipidemia that lead to severe aortic valve sclerosis and stenosis with subsequent aortic valve replacement in 2004 with a bioprosthetic valve. His valvular  Heart disease has led to left ventricular enlargement and a diastolic dysfunction with a preserved ejection fraction, pulmonary artery hypertension, biatrial enlargement and persistent atrial fibrillation. He is not on any anticoagulantion, which is due to history of non-compliance. Indeed, he was admitted to the hospital in 2001 with an INR of 9.8. His cardiologist is Dr. RC and I have viewed his outpatient notes. The anticoagulation for his bioprosthetic valve and  atrial fibrillation is management with aspirin only. He has not had any DVTs, pulmonary embolism or strokes. There is no family history of blood clots that he knows of. The last time he was seen by Dr.RC was November 2008. At that time,  he was complaining of dypnea and wheezing. He was believed to be suffering from decompensated diastolic heart failure and an echo at that time showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular ejection fraction was normal. The left atrium was moderately dilated, the right atrium is mild to moderately dilated and there was mild mitral regurgitation. The gradient across the AVR was 36 mm per hg. This was changed from an echo in 2006.  His last six weeks continued and his Atacand was increased. His atrial fibrillation was well controlled at the time. He does not have a significant history of alcohol abuse. He has drunk alcohol for a majority of his life, he says, since the age of 16. He continued to drink alcohol regularly.  He says he was in the Japanese Navy and he was in the military for quite some time. He equates his with a habit of excessive alcohol abuse.",,2534,,a0b8f639-79b3-4e5d-9a26-a575e27f8741,Production-Test-Set-Quality,a803a5ad-530d-4c18-bf4f-a9671e672d80,LABELER,ACTIVE,19-25,Male,Yoruba,Non-Health,,IntronHealth,Researcher,"Abuja, Nigeria",NG,0,0,0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,
